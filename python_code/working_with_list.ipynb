    "# Working with Lists\n",
    "In this lecture you’ll learn how to loop through an entire list using just a few lines of code regardless of how long the list is. Looping allows you to take the same action, or set of actions, with every item in a list. As a result, you’ll be able to work efficiently with lists of any length, including those with thousands or even millions of items.\n",

    "## Looping Through an Entire List\n",
    "You’ll often want to run through all entries in a list, performing the same task with each item. For example, in a game you might want to move every element on the screen by the same amount, or in a list of numbers you might want to perform the same statistical operation on every element. Or perhaps you’ll want to display each headline from a list of articles on a website. When you want to do the same action with every item in a list, you can use Python’s for loop.\n",
    "Let’s say we have a list of magicians’ names, and we want to print out each name in the list. We could do this by retrieving each name from the list individually, but this approach could cause several problems. For one, it would be repetitive to do this with a long list of names. Also, we’d have to change our code each time the list’s length changed. A for loop avoids both of these issues by letting Python manage these issues internally. Let’s use a for loop to print out each name in a list of magicians:"

    "## Avoiding Indentation Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation to determine how a line, or group of lines, is related to the rest of the program. In the previous examples, the lines that printed messages to individual magicians were part of the for loop because they were indented. Python’s use of indentation makes code very easy to read. Basically, it uses whitespace to force you to write neatly formatted code with a clear visual structure. In longer Python programs, you’ll notice blocks of code indented at a few different levels. These indentation levels help you gain a general sense of the overall program’s organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you begin to write code that relies on proper indentation, you’ll need to watch for a few common indentation errors. For example, people sometimes indent lines of code that don’t need to be indented or forget to indent lines that need to be indented. Seeing examples of these errors now will help you avoid them in the future and correct them when they do appear in your own programs.\n",
