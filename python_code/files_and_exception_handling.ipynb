    "# Files and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you’ve mastered the basic skills you need to write organized programs that are easy to use, it’s time to think about making your programs even more relevant and usable. In this chapter you’ll learn to work with files so your programs can quickly analyze lots of data. You’ll learn to handle errors so your programs don’t crash when they encounter unexpected situations. You’ll learn about exceptions, which are special objects Python creates to manage errors that arise while a program is running. You’ll also learn about the json module, which allows you to save user data so it isn’t lost when your program stops running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to work with files and save data will make your programs easier for people to use. Users will be able to choose what data to enter and when to enter it. People can run your program, do some work, and then close the program and pick up where they left off later. Learning to handle exceptions will help you deal with situations in which files don’t exist and deal with other problems that can cause your programs to crash. This will make your programs more robust when they encounter bad data, whether it comes from innocent mistakes or from malicious attempts to break your programs. With the skills you’ll learn in this chapter, you’ll make your programs more applicable, usable, and stable.\n",

    "## READING FROM A FILE \n",
    "\n",
    "An incredible amount of data is available in text files. Text files can contain weather data, traffic data, socioeconomic data, literary works, and more. Reading from a file is particularly useful in data analysis applications, but it’s also applicable to any situation in which you want to analyze or modify information stored in a file. For example, you can write a program that reads in the contents of a text file and rewrites the file with formatting that allows a browser to display it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to work with the information in a text file, the first step is to read the file into memory. You can read the entire contents of a file, or you can work through the file one line at a time.\n",

    "### Reading an Entire File\n",

    "To begin, we need a file with a few lines of text in it. Let’s start with a file that contains pi to 30 decimal places, with 10 decimal places per line:\n",

    "The first line of this program has a lot going on. Let’s start by looking at the open() function. To do any work with a file, even just printing its contents, you first need to open the file to access it. The open() function needs one argument: the name of the file you want to open. Python looks for this file in the directory where the program that’s currently being executed is stored. In this example, file_reader.py is currently running, so Python looks for pi_digits.txt in the directory where file_reader.py is stored. The open() function returns an object representing the file. Here, open('pi_digits.txt') returns an object representing pi_digits.txt. Python assigns this object to file_object, which we’ll work with later in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword with closes the file once access to it is no longer needed. Notice how we call open() in this program but not close(). You could open and close the file by calling open() and close(), but if a bug in your program prevents the close() method from being executed, the file may never close. This may seem trivial, but improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted. And if you call close() too early in your program, you’ll find yourself trying to work with a closed file (a file you can’t access), which leads to more errors. It’s not always easy to know exactly when you should close a file, but with the structure shown here, Python will figure that out for you. All you have to do is open the file and work with it as desired, trusting that Python will close it automatically when the with block finishes execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a file object representing pi_digits.txt, we use the read() method in the second line of our program to read the entire contents of the file and store it as one long string in contents. When we print the value of contents, we get the entire text file back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between this output and the original file is the extra blank line at the end of the output. The blank line appears because read() returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file; this empty string shows up as a blank line. If you want to remove the extra blank line, you can use rstrip() in the call to print():"

    "Sometimes, depending on how you organize your work, the file you want to open won’t be in the same directory as your program file. For example, you might store your program files in a folder called python_work; inside python_work, you might have another folder called text_files to distinguish your program files from the text files they’re manipulating. Even though text_files is in python_work, just passing open() the name of a file in text_files won’t work, because Python will only look in python_work and stop there; it won’t go on and look in text_files. To get Python to open files from a directory other than the one where your program file is stored, you need to provide a file path, which tells Python to look in a specific location on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because text_files is inside python_work, you could use a relative file path to open a file from text_files. A relative file path tells Python to look for a given location relative to the directory where the currently running program file is stored. For example, you’d write:\n",

You use an absolute path if a relative path doesn’t work. For instance, if you’ve put text_files in some folder other than python_work—say, a folder called other_files—then just passing open() the path 'text_files/filename.txt' won’t work because Python will only look for that location inside python_work. You’ll need to write out a full path to clarify where you want Python to look.\n",
