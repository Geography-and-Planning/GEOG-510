    "# Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture you’ll learn how to use Python’s dictionaries, which allow you to connect pieces of related information. You’ll learn how to access the information once it’s in a dictionary and how to modify that information. Because dictionaries can store an almost limitless amount of information, I’ll show you how to loop through the data in a dictionary. Additionally, you’ll learn to nest dictionaries inside lists, lists inside dictionaries, and even dictionaries inside other dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding dictionaries allows you to model a variety of real-world objects more accurately. You’ll be able to create a dictionary representing a person and then store as much information as you want about that person. You can store their name, age, location, profession, and any other aspect of a person you can describe. You’ll be able to store any two kinds of information that can be matched up, such as a list of words and their meanings, a list of people’s names and their favorite numbers, a list of mountains and their elevations, and so forth.\n",

    "In this chapter you learned how to define a dictionary and how to work with the information stored in a dictionary. You learned how to access and modify individual elements in a dictionary, and how to loop through all of the information in a dictionary. You learned to loop through a dictionary’s key-value pairs, its keys, and its values. You also learned how to nest multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary inside a dictionary.|"
